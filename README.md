# Autonomous_CyberAI_Website

The Autonomous cyber-AI is  meant to detect all kind of network threats including zero days using an AI engine which is trained using deep learning techniques such as artificial neural network, natural language processing, to analyze any suspicious or abnormal behaviors in the system using the network logs. By integrate the AI engine on a cloud environment, Autonomous Cyber AI became a lightwight detection system, that can be adopted on either low specification machines.

This is the showcase website of this research.
